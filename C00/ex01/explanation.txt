------------ascii table-------------

- the Ascii table is an indexed list of char with an assigned numerical value for each of them

- To display the alphabet we need to use the ascii table (check the man ascii)

- In the ascii  table all alphabet's letters in lowercase follow each other 

exemple :
           Dec | Char
           ---------
           97  | a
           98  | b
           99  | c
           ..  | ..
           122 | z

- So in a function you can write either one or the other, it's the same :
                                                                            .char c = 'a'
                                                                            .char c = 97

------------How it work, step by step------------------

step 1 : we create a char and then assigne him the char 'a' 

step 2(the loop) : 
                    - the 'while loop' will continue while the char c (that's equal to 'a') is inferior or equal to the char 'z'
                    - in the loop we're calling the function ft_putchar that will write my char 

c++ explanation :
                   - the c++ will wil do c + 1 after writing the char
                   - for example : 
                                  .after the first ft_putchar -> c = 'a' + 1 wich mean that c = 97 + 1 = 98 = 'b'   
 
!- if you want to write a char without his Decimal value you have to put it beetwen ''. 
!- You can use the same logic for ex02 and ex03.
